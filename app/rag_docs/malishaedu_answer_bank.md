Our team can provide specific accommodation details for your chosen university.

Major cities with significant Muslim populations typically have better halal food options, including university canteens with halal sections, nearby halal restaurants, and halal-certified food vendors. We can help you identify universities in cities with good halal food access.

**Q: Can I work part-time while studying?**
A: Part-time work is possible but regulated. Students must obtain approval from their university and complete local permission procedures before working. Regulations vary by city and work type.

We recommend focusing on studies first and discussing work opportunities with your university's international office after arrival.
